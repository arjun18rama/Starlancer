# 🚀 Starlancer

**Starlancer** is a next-gen proxy + AI tooling platform built with performance, stealth, and flexibility in mind. Developed by **Arjun** and powered by **OpenAI Codex (o3)**, it's designed to push past traditional limits—whether you're bypassing filtered networks, logging command telemetry, or crafting a fully modular security-aware backend.

> ⚠️ This is an experimental project. Use ethically and responsibly.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔐 **Stealth Proxy Layer** – DNS-safe, with potential Securly evasive tactics (in progress)
- ⚙️ **Rate-limited Express server** – Secure, tunable request handling
- 🌍 **Docker-ready** – Fast deploys across any Linux VM
- 📈 **SQLite telemetry tracking** – Logs command metadata, timestamps, and response types
- 📊 **Web dashboard (WIP)** – FastAPI or Node-based analytics panel
- 🤖 **Codex-injected tools** – Ready for AI-augmented commands and task generation

## 📦 Stack

| Component | Tech |
|----------|------|
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Data Layer | SQLite |
| Proxy Logic | Custom (via Express middleware, more to come) |
| Containerization | Docker + pnpm |
| AI Automation | Codex (via OpenAI CLI or Copilot Chat) |

🧠 Philosophy

We didn’t just write code. We built a framework to learn, test, and challenge what’s possible with code + AI agents. Every piece is a deliberate step toward something better—cleaner, smarter, faster.

“We’re not here to copy. We’re here to create.”

Built with ✨ by Arjun + Codex.
